CINNABON RECIPE

INGRIDIENTS

DOUGH:
-Active dry yeast – You can use instant yeast if that’s what you have. If you use instant, you won’t need to bloom it first, but it’s a good idea to test if it’s still alive. If your yeast doesn’t foam up your yeast is dead and the bread won’t turn out.

-Milk – make sure the milk is lukewarm. Lukewarm basically means the milk is between 98 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 40.5 C). I used whole milk (3.25%) but you can use whatever is in your fridge.

-Sugar – granulated sugar is fine, we just need a bit to sweeten the dough.

-Butter – unsalted as always. Unsalted butter gives us control on how much sodium is in our food.

-Salt – we always need to add a bit of salt to our baked goods, to bring out all the flavors. Salt basically makes everything taste better.

-Eggs – Use large eggs for this recipe.

-Flour – I used all-purpose flour for this.

FILLING:

-Brown sugar – I prefer to use dark brown sugar. Make sure it’s packed.

-Cinnamon – the key ingredient in cinnamon rolls!

-Butter – unsalted again. You’ll want to make sure this is softened. Margarine can be used as well.

CREAM CHEESE ICING:

-Butter – unsalted butter is what you’ll want to use.

-Powdered sugar – this is also known as icing sugar or confectioner’s sugar.

-Cream cheese – at room temperature. I always use Philadelphia cream cheese.

-Vanilla extract – just a bit to add a touch of vanilla in the icing.

-Salt – a little bit is all you need to bring out all the flavors.

RECIPE

-Bloom the yeast: Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. You can add a tsp of sugar from the sugar needed for the dough to help activate the yeast. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes until it has foamed up nicely. If your yeast doesn’t get foamy, don’t move forward. Buy a new jar and store it in the freezer so it lasts longer.

-Make the dough: To the bowl of your mixer add the sugar, butter or margarine, salt, eggs, and flour and mix until well incorporated. Pour the milk/yeast mixture over the flour mixture and using the dough hook, mix well until well incorporated. Place the dough into an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.

-Prepare filling: Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.

How To Roll Cinnamon Rolls:

-Assemble cinnamon rolls: Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is approximately 16 inches long by 12 inches wide. It should be approximately 1/4 inch in thickness. Spread the 1/3 cup of butter evenly over the dough, then sprinkle with the sugar evenly over the surface of the dough. Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge. Cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch slices, and place in a lightly greased baking pan. You can also use floss to cut into slices, as seen in the video. Place the cut rolls in buttered pan. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rise for another 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.

-Bake the cinnamon rolls: Bake them in a preheated 350 F degree oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.

-Make icing: While the rolls are baking make the icing by mixing all the icing ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy and smooth. When the rolls are done, spread generously with icing.

My Best Tips:

-Make sure your yeast has not expired. The number 1 question I get from my readers is “Why didn’t my dough rise?”. The answer always lies with your yeast. Test the yeast first before wasting ingredients. Try and bloom it and if it doesn’t get foamy, your yeast is no good.

-Don’t overheat your milk! Using milk that is too hot will kill your yeast and this will also prevent your dough from rising. Make sure your  milk is between 98 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 40.5 C).

-Use room temperature butter. This is for both the dough and the filling. To do this, take the butter out of the fridge a few hours before you plan to make the dough. Give it enough time to soften.
